Tell your children not to walk my way
Tell your children not to hear my words

Can you keep them in the dark for life?
Can you hide them from the waiting world?
Oh mother
Father
Gonna take your daughter out tonight
Gonna show her my world
Oh father
Not about to see your light
But if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
'Til you're bleeding
Not about to see your light
And if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's

Tell your children not to hold my hand
Tell your children not to understand

Do you wanna feel everything?

And if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
'Til you're bleeding
Not about to see your light
And if you wanna find hell with me
I can show you what it's
